# capital-one-challenge
This is the challenge that I completed for the Capital One Software Engineering summer position.

I have chosen to develop in node, in order to run the file you must have node installed.

You must navigate to the main directory of the folder in the command line and type:

`npm install`

to download all of the dependencies and then:

`node fileAnalyzer.js`

to analize all of the files in the checkin-directory
